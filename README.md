## Datasets

- RWKU
  - Description: This dataset is designed to test large language models' ability to unlearn real-world knowledge. It contains 200 unlearning targets and 13,131 forget probes, including fill-in-the-blank, question-answer, and adversarial attack probes. The task is to forget famous people from Wikipedia. The evaluation suite assesses knowledge memorization and manipulation through regular and adversarial settings, as well as membership inference attacks. It also evaluates general ability, reasoning, truthfulness, factuality, and fluency. The unlearning task does not assume access to the forget or retain corpora, as the pre-training data of most language models is not easily accessible.

- TOFU
  - Description: A synthetic QA dataset of fictitious authors generated by GPT-4. The datasets comes with three splits of the retain/forget sets, including 99/1, 95/5, and 90/10 (in percentage). The dataset also includes questions about real authors and world facts to evaluate the loss of general knowledge after unlearning.

- WMDP
  - Description: A benchmark for assessing hazardous knowledge in biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity, containing about 4000 multiple-choice questions with similar style to MMLU. It also comes with corpora in the three domains.

- MMLU Subsets
  - Description: A task proposed along with the WMDP dataset. The goal is to unlearn (retain) three categories in the [MMLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300) dataset: economics (econometrics and others), physics (math and others), and law (jurisprudence and others). The task requires high-precision unlearning, because the retain sets are categories closely related to the unlearning categories.

- arXiv, GitHub, and copyrighted books corpus
  - Description: A dataset for evaluating approximate unlearning algorithms for pre-trained LLMs. The dataset contains both forget and retain splits of each category, and comes with both in-distribution and general retain sets. The dataset is deisgned for unlearning directly on pre-trained models, as they are random samples from the pre-training dataset of [Yi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04652).
